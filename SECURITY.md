### 1. Purpose

The Zard Programming Language ("Zard") is released as open source software. This license ensures that Zard is free to use, modify, and distribute, while preserving the communityâ€™s collective contribution. Users may freely build applications and commercial projects using Zard, but the core compiler and runtime may not be commercially sold or relicensed for profit without explicit permission from the copyright holder.

---

### 2. Permissions

* **Free of charge**: Zard can be downloaded, used, and distributed without royalties.
* **Commercial use**: Applications and services created *with* Zard may be commercial.
* **Modification**: You may modify the Zard source code.
* **Forks**: Public or private forks are allowed.
* **Contribution requirement**: Substantial modifications to the Zard core (compiler, runtime, IR generation) must be reported and contributed back to the central repository, to maintain community benefit.

---

### 3. Restrictions

* **No selling the compiler**: You may not sell, relicense, or commercially exploit the Zard core compiler or runtime as a product.
* **Closed forks**: Private forks are permitted only if improvements are made available to the community when distributed or deployed outside personal use.

### 4. Warranty Disclaimer

Zard is provided "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of this software.

### 5. Compatibility with External Tools

Zard makes use of the **LLVM toolchain and Clang compiler** for code generation. These components are covered by the **Apache License 2.0 with LLVM exceptions**, which apply independently of this license. Usage of LLVM/Clang does not modify their licensing terms, and this project does not distribute LLVM/Clang code within its source tree.

---

### 6. Summary

* Free for all users.
* Free for commercial applications built with it.
* No commercialization of the compiler itself.
* Improvements to the compiler/runtime must be contributed back.
* LLVM/Clang remain under Apache 2.0 license.
